Ranger 7 - first completely successful Ranger lunar impact mission. Data from
'Ranger 7 flight path and its determination from tracking data', 15 Dec 1964

The report had a table of geocentric state vectors in the True of Date system
starting at injection and continuing every hour on the hour until impact. The
report also had selenocentric state vectors starting at 6:00 GMT 31 Jul 1964,
including one at time of impact, 1964 Jul 31 13:25:48.724 GMT

These vectors were manually entered into a spreadsheet and verified by checking
the magnitude of the radius and velocity vectors, which always matched to within
1 unit in the last place (several errors were caught this way).

These vectors were then run through the IDL elorb() routine to convert them to
orbit elements. These elements were then interpolated from ~1 hour spacing to
1 second spacing. These 1 second elements were then run through mkspk as described
in this file. The report values of Earth and Moon GM are used, not the modern
values. For this reason, the elements on the hour should reproduce the input
states to the last decimal place.

The geocentric states are completely accurate at the original table points, with 
accuracy between the points determined by the validity and accuracy of the linear
interpolation of the elements.
